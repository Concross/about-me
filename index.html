            <h2>BIO</h2>

            <p id="bio-paragraph">Hello, my name is Connor and I love learning how to code! I live in beautiful Bend, OR with my fiancee, my big
                fluffy dog, and most of my family. When I'm not at home you can probably find me at GoodLife, playing rugby,
                or up in the mountains trying to catch fish.</p>

    <!-- Educational Background -->
    <ul id="education-section">
        <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
        <li>
            <h3>CodeFellows via Apprenti</h3>
            <p>I'm currently enrolled in this awesome program called Apprenti where we follow the CodeFellows course curriculum
                for 22 weeks on our way to becoming Full Stack .NET Developers. After this training sprint I will be working
                for a full year with CBT Nuggets as an apprentice!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>University of Oregon</h3>
            <p>I acquired my B.S. in Psychology in 2016 along with a Business minor. My extracurricular activities revolved
                around the UO Rugby Club where I wore many hats from Treasurer, to player coach, to president.</p>

        <h2>PAST EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <li>
            <h3>Terra Frma</h3>
            <p>In the beginning of 2018 I had the opportunity to help the wonderful women of Terra Frma launch their website.
                Most of my work there consisted of minor/major thematic tweaks to a base Shopify theme. Sometimes I found
                myself to be a little out of my league but I did my best to make it work. It wasn't always pretty, in fact
                it was probably never pretty, but it worked!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>UPS</h3>
            <p>After graduating in 2016 I jumped on the first job I could find to get some money in my pocket. I landed at UPS
                as a preloader during the peak delivery season (holidays). This was one of the most stressful and exciting
                jobs I've had to date. It can get overwhelming when you're buried in boxes, your trucks are already full
                and there's no end in site. But it taught me to focus on doing things efficiently whenever possible and that
                sometimes you just need to knuckle down and push through to the end.</p>
