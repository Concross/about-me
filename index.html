    <h1>About me!</h1>

    <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>Hello, my name is Connor and I love learning how to code! I live in beautiful Bend, OR with my fiancee, my big fluffy dog, and most of my family. When I'm not at home you can probably find me at GoodLife, playing rugby, or up in the mountains trying to catch fish.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>

        <h3>CodeFellows via Apprenti</h3>
            <p>I'm currently enrolled in this awesome program called Apprenti where we follow the CodeFellows course curriculum for 22 weeks on our way to becoming Full Stack .NET Developers. After this training sprint I will be working for a full year with CBT Nuggets as an apprentice!</p>

        <h3>University of Oregon</h3>
            <p>I acquired my B.S. in Psychology back in 2016 along with a Business minor. My extracurricular activities revolved around the UO Rugby Club where I wore many hats from Treasurer, to player coach, to president.</p>

    <h2>Past experience</h2>
        <h3>UPS</h3>
            <p>After graduating back in 2016 I jumped on the first job I could find to get some money in my pocket. I landed at UPS as a preloader during the peak delivery season (holidays). This was one of the most stressful and exciting jobs I've had to date. It can get overwhelming when you're buried in boxes, your trucks are already full and there's no end in site. But it taught me to focus on doing things efficiently whenever possible and that sometimes you just need to knuckle down and push through to the end.</p>
