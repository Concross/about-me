            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Welcome to me! I'm a fullstack software developer currently living in the beer-loving town of Bend, OR. If I'm
                not camping up in the mountains with my fiancee and my big fluffy doggo you might find me in town drinking
                beer at GoodLife, playing rugby, or learning some new game. </p>
            <p>I fell in love with software development because it gives me the opportunity to flex my creative (albeit not-so-artistic)
                muscle and solve difficult problems. Creating meaningful software as a part of thoughtful and intelligent
                teams motivates me like nothing else.
            </p>

                    <p>This is a project I created as part of the Apprenti program via CodeFellows. It represents my first crack
                        at taking on a project to meet client demands. It also serves as my own little playground for trying
                        out new approaches as I learn them. I kept the original design the same though, you're welcome. Feast
                        your eyes on it's hideous glory!

                    <h4>Bus Mall</h4>
                    <p>This may just look like a simple shopping cart web app for ground transport's answer to Sky Mall, and
                        it is! The idea behind this project was to create a simple site for market research where focus groups
                        could vote for which products they would like to see in a Bus Mall magazine when they travel the
                        roads in public transit. Take a look and vote for you favorites!
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <h4>Typing++</h4>
                    <p>If you write code for a living and feel like your fingers fumble around for those clumsy syntax keys
                        then you'll want to check this project out. Our Apprenti cohort came together to produce this beauty
                        in 3 short days, all in vanilla JavaScript. The biggest takeway from developing this site was learning
                        how to work as a team. We hit some bumps early but chose to adapt and overcome. At the end, our team
                        was a well-oiled machine in a very brief amount of time. Huge accomplishment!
