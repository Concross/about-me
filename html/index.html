    <!-- Brief bio about Connor! -->
    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p id="bio-paragraph">Hello, my name is Connor and I love learning how to code! I live in beautiful Bend, OR with my fiancee, my big fluffy
        dog, and most of my family. When I'm not at home you can probably find me at GoodLife, playing rugby, or up in the
        mountains trying to catch fish.</p>

    <!-- Educational Background -->
    <h2>Education</h2>

    <h3>CodeFellows via Apprenti</h3>
    <p>I'm currently enrolled in this awesome program called Apprenti where we follow the CodeFellows course curriculum for
        22 weeks on our way to becoming Full Stack .NET Developers. After this training sprint I will be working for a full
        year with CBT Nuggets as an apprentice!</p>

    <h3>University of Oregon</h3>
    <p>I acquired my B.S. in Psychology in 2016 along with a Business minor. My extracurricular activities revolved around the
        UO Rugby Club where I wore many hats from Treasurer, to player coach, to president.</p>

    <!-- Prior Work Experience -->
    <h2>Past Experience</h2>

    <h3>Terra Frma</h3>
    <p>In the beginning of 2018 I had the opportunity to help the wonderful women of Terra Frma launch their website. Most of
        my work there consisted of minor/major thematic tweaks to a base Shopify theme. Sometimes I found myself to be a
        little out of my league but I did my best to make it work. It wasn't always pretty, in fact it was probably never
        pretty, but it worked!</p>

    <h3>UPS</h3>
    <p>After graduating in 2016 I jumped on the first job I could find to get some money in my pocket. I landed at UPS as a
        preloader during the peak delivery season (holidays). This was one of the most stressful and exciting jobs I've had
        to date. It can get overwhelming when you're buried in boxes, your trucks are already full and there's no end in
        site. But it taught me to focus on doing things efficiently whenever possible and that sometimes you just need to
        knuckle down and push through to the end.</p>
